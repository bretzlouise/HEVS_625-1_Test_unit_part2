 Work description: 
 
 Create a new application based on your previous projects.  
We want a program that does 0 to 3 filters and 0 to 3 edge detections (symmetrical). The code must have the maximum possible code coverage. 
Features expected: 
-	Load an image from the disk
-	Perform 0 to 3 filters and 0 to 3 edge detections
-	Save the modified image into a file
